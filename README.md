The python files show the development of a model through the practicals 1-9. The final version of the model creates ten sets of agents that are plotted on a scatterplot. An environment is created that appears as a raster graph on the plot. The code causes the values of these agents to change, in order to cause them to move positions on the scatterplot. The agents can be seen to move about over the environment.
